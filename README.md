# FORGE — Flexible Optimization of Routes for GHG & Energy

**FORGE** is a transparent, YAML-driven steel plant model that computes **cradle-to-gate** energy use and GHG emissions across multiple routes (BF-BOF, DRI-EAF, EAF-scrap) and downstream options. It supports route locking by scenario, on-site electricity crediting, sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo uncertainty.

**AI assistance:** Portions of the Python were generated from author-written prompts; model design, review, validation, and all architectural decisions are human-led.


## Features
- Route-locked scenarios (BF-BOF, DRI-EAF, EAF-scrap, External)
- Clean stage boundaries: **Pig iron**, **Crude steel**, **Finished**
- Explicit recipes + energy matrix (shares), energy contents, and carrier EFs
- On-site utility-plant electricity crediting (no double counting)
- 1-D sensitivity sweeps + Monte Carlo with pinned seeds
- Streamlit UI for picks (AND/OR recipe graph) and charts

## Data bundles
- Datasets now live under `datasets/<sector>/<variant>/` (e.g., `datasets/steel/likely`, `datasets/aluminum/baseline`).
- The Streamlit app opens with a sector gate so you can select *Steel* or *Aluminum* before choosing a dataset variant.

## Install
Requires **Python ≥ 3.10**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafaelmosquim/forge.git
cd forge
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick start (Streamlit)
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
In the main UI:
1. Landing screen → Sector = Steel, click Continue
2. Sidebar → Dataset = Likely, Grid = BRA, Product = Validation (as-cast)
2. Sidebar → pick a Route (BF-BOF / DRI-EAF / EAF-scrap)
3. Main → Tab = Main Model → Run model
4. Reported Crude steel (as-cast) CO₂e matches Table 1 in the paper.

## CLI batch runner
When you already know the scenario and route selections you can execute the model headlessly:

```bash
python steel_batch_cli.py run \
  --scenario datasets/steel/likely/scenarios/BF_BOF_coal.yml \
  --route BF-BOF \
  --stage-key Cast \
  --stage-role validation \
  --country-code BRA
```

`steel_batch_cli.py --help` lists additional options for supplying batches, override files, and pick lists.

## Tests
Run the lightweight consistency checks:

```bash
pytest
```
