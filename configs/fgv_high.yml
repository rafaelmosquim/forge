    notes: >
      Apply thermal treatments on the downstream (IP3) slice:
      30% Steel Thermal Treatment, 23% Hot Dip Metal Coating, 3% Electrolytic Metal Coating,
      44% bypass/no treatment. 20% of total steel goes through Cold Rolling (not 20% of the hot slice).
      Shares below preserve the long/flat split with that correction.
