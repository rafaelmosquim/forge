    notes: >
      Apply routing as follows: 83% of post-casting steel goes to Hot Rolling
      and 17% to Rod/bar; 90% of the Hot Rolling tonnage proceeds to Cold Rolling.
      All thermal and coating treatments are applied only to steel that goes
      through Cold Rolling; steel bypassing Cold Rolling and all rod/bar products
      receive no downstream thermal treatment. Of the Cold Rolling output, one
      third goes to Steel Thermal Treatment and the remaining two thirds go to
      coatings (88% Hot Dip, 12% Electrolytic). This results in six products:
      four flat (HR only, HR+CR+Thermal, HR+CR+Hot Dip, HR+CR+Electrolytic) and
      two long (machining and extrusion, both without treatment).
