    notes: >
      Apply routing as follows: 83% of post-casting steel goes to Hot Rolling
      and 17% to Rod/bar; 90% of the Hot Rolling tonnage proceeds to Cold Rolling.
      All thermal and coating treatments are applied only to steel that goes
      through Cold Rolling; steel bypassing Cold Rolling and all rod/bar products
      receive no downstream thermal treatment. Of the Cold Rolling output, 88%
      goes to Hot Dip Metal Coating and 12% to Electrolytic Metal Coating; from
      each coated stream, 33.3% proceeds to Steel Thermal Treatment and 66.6%
      bypasses into IP4. This yields six products: four flat (HR only; HR+CR with
      Hot Dip bypass; HR+CR with Hot Dip + Thermal; HR+CR with Electrolytic bypass
      or Thermal) and two long (machining and extrusion, both without treatment).
