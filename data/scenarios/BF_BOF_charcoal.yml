route_overrides:
  Blast Furnace: 1.0
  Basic Oxygen Furnace: 1.0
  Electric Arc Furnace: 0.0
  Direct Reduction Iron: 0.0
  Charcoal from Market: 0.0   # optional, to force Wood → kiln path
  Charcoal Production: 1.0
  Coke Production: 1.0

fuel_substitutions:
  Coal: Charcoal
  Coke: Charcoal
  PCI Coal from Market: Charcoal

energy_int:                # only lines that differ from base
  Blast Furnace: 14.95       # +15 % vs coal BF

recipe_overrides:
  Charcoal Production:
    inputs: { Wood: 2.5226 }
    outputs: { Charcoal (raw): 1.0 }

  Coke Production:
    inputs:
      Nitrogen: 0.02
      Charcoal (raw): 1.25
    outputs:
      Charcoal (BF): 1.0
      Process Gas: "process_gas_coke * (inputs['Charcoal (raw)'] * energy_content['Charcoal'])"

  Sintering:
    inputs:
      Iron Ore: "feo3_sinter / feo3_lump"
      Limestone: 0.140
      Charcoal (BF): >
        energy_int['Sintering'] * energy_shares['Sintering']['Charcoal'] / energy_content['Charcoal']
    outputs: { Sinter: 1.0 }
