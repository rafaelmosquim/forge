route_overrides:
  Blast Furnace: 1.0
  Basic Oxygen Furnace: 1.0
  Electric Arc Furnace: 0.0
  Direct Reduction Iron: 0.0
  Charcoal Production: 1.0
  Charcoal from Market: 0.0
  Coke Production: 0.0
  Coke from market: 0.0
  Coal from Market: 0.0
  PCI Coal from Market: 0.0

# optional; fine to keep
fuel_substitutions:
  Coal: Charcoal
  PCI Coal from Market: Charcoal

energy_int:
  Blast Furnace: 14.95

# ðŸ”‘ This is what the app uses to compute BF "Coke/Coal/Charcoal" inputs
energy_matrix:
  Blast Furnace:
    Coke: 0.0
    Coal: 0.0
    Charcoal: 1.0

recipe_overrides:
  # Belt-and-suspenders: force BF coke/coal to zero;
  # (don't override Charcoal to "1.0" â€“ the share above will compute the right mass)
  Blast Furnace:
    inputs:
      Coke: 0.0
      Coal: 0.0

  Charcoal Production:
    inputs:  { Wood: 2.5226 }
    outputs: { Charcoal (raw): 1.0 }

  # Since Coke Production is disabled, this block is unnecessary; remove or leave harmlessly
  # Coke Production:
  #   inputs:
  #     Nitrogen: 0.02
  #     Charcoal (raw): 1.25
  #   outputs:
  #     Coke: 1.0
  #     Process Gas: "process_gas_coke * (inputs['Charcoal (raw)'] * energy_content['Charcoal'])"

  # Use the standard 'Charcoal' token here (not "Charcoal (BF)")
  Sintering:
    inputs:
      Iron Ore: "feo3_sinter / feo3_lump"
      Limestone: 0.140
      Charcoal: "energy_int['Sintering'] * energy_shares['Sintering']['Charcoal'] / energy_content['Charcoal']"
    outputs: { Sinter: 1.0 }
